learnfs:	Learn filesystem module
Author:		Ritesh Harjani <ritesh.harjani@gmail.com>
==========================================

Description:	learnfs is a small & simple Ram based filesystem
module which mainly uses the existing library API's of fs/libfs.c

Main goal of writing learnfs is to understand
"How to write a linux filesystem"

Since it is not disk based fs, so there will be no disk I/O
involved in this case and the address_space mapping APIs will be
straight forward.

learnfs:- Since it is written from scratch, every commit of this
will describe the actual process of writing a filesystem.

While writing sdcardfs & ramfs code was considered as reference.


TODO:-
1. Implement address_space mapping operation on it's own instead of using libfs.
2. Implement symlink/hardlinks.
3. Remove all libfs.c code and implement yourself.

To Cross compile for ARM:-

export KDIR=<kernel build/kobj path>
export CC=<cross compiler>
make
